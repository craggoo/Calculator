Calculator
==========

Calculator project on Odinproject

The calculator cannot do different operations at the same time.

For example, 5*6/7 will not output the right answer, but calculating 
5*6 then dividing that answer by 7 will output the right answer. 

You can chain together as many calculations as you want as long as
they are all using the same operator
